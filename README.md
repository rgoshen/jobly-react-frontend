<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://react-jobly-rg.surge.sh/)

This is the front end for an Express.js backend found [here](https://github.com/rgoshen/jobly-express-backend). It allows the user to login/logout, list all companies in the database, click on a company card to list the available jobs of the individual company and "apply" by clicking the Apply button. The app will store all the jobs the user applied to. It also allows the user to search for a company by name or handle and job by title. Lastly, allows the user to update their own profile.

### Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rgoshen/jobly-react-frontend.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Clone the backend repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rgoshen/jobly-express-backend
```

4. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

### Start the app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
